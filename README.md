# MalwareFinder
MalwareFinder is a .NET application I wrote to help with the Berzerk Anti-Malware project I am working on. The purpose of this project is to pull malware samples from multiple sources for analysis. Here is a list of currently supported sources:

#### Sources
* Malc0de http://malc0de.com/rss/
* VXVault http://vxvault.net/URL_List.php
* URLQuery http://urlquery.net/

I will be adding more sources in the future as I locate them and find the time to write a parser for them. If you have any suggestions please feel free to open an issue as an enhancement. 

## WARNING
Please note that this these sources are real, live malware samples and are considered dangerous. Please under no circumstances download these samples on your computer, take the appropriate safey precautions (e.g. Virtual Machine) or use a computer that you don't mind being destroyed. The sources pulled contain numerous types of dangerous files including but not limited to:
* Trojans
* Worms
* Adware
* Ransomware
* Other harmful virus

## Currently Implemented Features 
* Download multiple samples simultaneously
* Generate MD5 Hash of samples 
  * Delete duplicate samples 
* Local database of previous downloaded samples (based on URL) 

## Todo List: 
* Implement command line arguements 
  * Specify amount of downloaders 
  * Specify output directory
